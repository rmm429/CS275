<!-- A paragraph within the div about the history of the Fibonacci sequence -->
<p>The Fibonacci Sequence are the numbers are characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceeding ones.  By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.  The Fibonacci Sequence was discovered by Leonardo of Pisa, better known by his nickname Fibonacci, while looing at how generations of rabbits breed.  It was noted that after each monthy generation, the number of pairs of rabbits increased from 1 to 2 to 3 to 5 to 8 to 13, etc. and identified how the sequence progressed by adding the previous two terms, a sequence which could in theory extend indefinitely.</p>
